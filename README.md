# telco-churnanalysis
📊 Telecom Churn Analysis with Machine Learning (Random Forest & Logistic Regression)<br>
📝 Overview<br>
<br />
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Using a customer dataset, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling with Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Model evaluation was conducted using Repeated K-Fold Cross Validation (5-Fold, 3 Repeats) to ensure stable results.

🔍 Workflow<br>
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning<br>
Handling missing values<br>
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding<br>
Normalizing numerical features for optimal model performance<br>
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
Analyzing churn distribution in the dataset<br>
Investigating relationships between features like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type with churn<br>
Visualizing data using Matplotlib & Seaborn<br>
3️⃣ Machine Learning Models<br>
🔹 Logistic Regression → A baseline model to understand feature relationships with churn<br>
🔹 Random Forest → A tree-based model that captures feature interactions and non-linearity<br>
<br />
4️⃣ Model Evaluation<br>
Repeated K-Fold Cross Validation (5-Fold, 3 Repeats) for robust performance assessment<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC<br>
